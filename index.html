    <h1>Saccha Agriel's <br> Creative Coding Portfolio</h1>
    <p class="info">Hi, I am Saccha Agriel. I am studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago and graduating in December 2020. My family is from Uruguay and I live in Rockford, Illinois. I spent most of my life living in South Florida. It was nice to live in warm weather and experience the beautiful sunrises.
 Some of my hobbies include drawing, going to parks, watching Netflix and trying new food places. I used to not be one to eat out, but Chicago has many amazing restaurants that are worth exploring. My favorite holiday is Halloween, because I can create different costumes, watch movies and eat candy.

    <p class="info">I am a beginner at creative coding and am very excited to have been introduced to this art field. Although I am new to creative coding, I have had an interest in art since I was little. I really enjoyed creating different types of crafts. In my free time, I like to draw. Usually, I choose pencil as my medium, because it allows me to make mistakes and I have been working with it for the longest.
      Although I am studying Computer Science, I never got into front-end development such as making a website page. Learning more on creative coding has allowed me to learn other languages/technologies like html and p5.js. It is interesting to see how you can use code to help your art create itself. I am excited to learn more and hope you have fun seeing what I have developed so far!
